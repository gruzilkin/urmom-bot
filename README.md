# urmom-bot / –º–∞–º–∫–∏–Ω –±–æ—Ç

## Adaptive Learning
The bot features an adaptive learning system that improves its joke generation over time:

- Learns from both AI-generated and user-contributed "ur mom" jokes
- Evaluates joke quality based on user reactions
- Uses popular jokes as reference material for generating new content

For a joke to be considered for learning (both bot-generated and user-contributed):
- Must be a reply to the original message that inspired the joke
- Must receive reactions from server members
- AI must confirm it's actually a joke

The learning system prioritizes jokes with higher engagement (more reactions) when creating new content, ensuring better quality over time.
