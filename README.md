# urmom-bot

A Discord bot that responds with "ur mom" jokes when messages are reacted to with a clown emoji (🤡).

## Features
- Generates custom "ur mom" jokes using AI
- Triggered by clown emoji reactions
- Powered by Google's Gemini AI

## Adaptive Learning
The bot features an adaptive learning system that improves its joke generation over time:

- Collects and stores jokes (both "ur mom" and "in Soviet Russia" variants)
- Learns from both AI-generated and user-contributed jokes
- Evaluates joke quality based on user reactions
- Uses popular jokes as reference material for generating new content

For a joke to be considered for learning (both bot-generated and user-contributed):
- Must be a reply to the original message that inspired the joke
- Must follow the "ur mom" or "in Soviet Russia" format
- Must receive reactions from server members

The learning system prioritizes jokes with higher engagement (more reactions) when creating new content, ensuring better quality over time.
